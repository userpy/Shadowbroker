"""HF NUFORC fallback honors the rolling cutoff window.

Background
----------
The UAP sightings layer is sourced primarily from a live scrape of
nuforc.org. When that fails (Cloudflare 403, curl disabled on Windows,
wdtNonce regex stale, etc.) the code falls back to a static CSV mirror
hosted on Hugging Face at ``kcimc/NUFORC/nuforc_str.csv``.

The HF mirror is maintained by a third party and refreshed sporadically.
Pre-fix, the fallback parsed every row, sorted by ``occurred`` descending,
and took the top 250 — **with no date cutoff**. When the HF mirror is
stale (its "newest" rows are ~2-3 years old), users saw a map full of
2022-2023 sightings labeled as the "last 60 days" layer.

These tests pin the new behavior:

* Rows older than ``_NUFORC_RECENT_DAYS`` are dropped before the take-top-N.
* If the HF mirror has nothing in the window, the fallback returns ``[]``
  and logs ERROR (don't silently serve stale data).
* ``fetch_uap_sightings`` records the failure when BOTH paths fail, so
  the layer shows as broken in the health registry instead of "fresh".
