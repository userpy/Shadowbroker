/**
 * useAisUpstreamHealth — polls /api/health and exposes AIS proxy connectivity.
 *
 * Background: AISStream's WebSocket server went fully offline 2026-05-23 (TCP
 * timeouts at stream.aisstream.io). The backend kept reconnecting in a tight
 * loop and the ships layer silently went empty. Users had no signal that the
 * problem was upstream, not their config. This hook surfaces the state so a
 * banner can explain "AIS upstream is offline" instead of letting users
 * wonder.
 *
 * The poll interval is intentionally relaxed (30s) — this is a low-urgency UX
 * signal, not a real-time data feed. Backend already escalates top_status to
 * "degraded" when AIS is configured-but-disconnected.
