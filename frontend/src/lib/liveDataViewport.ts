 * Shared module-level state for the current map viewport bounds, used by

 * area when the user has zoomed in.
 *
 * Issue #288: the backend now bbox-filters dense layers (vessels, aircraft,
 * gdelt events, fires, sigint, …) when all four bounds are supplied. Light
 * reference layers stay world-scale. Heavy collections aren't sent over the
 * wire for parts of the planet the operator isn't looking at, which cuts
 * the steady-state poll from ~27 MB to ~5 MB for a typical regional view.
 *
 * No bounds set → callers omit the params entirely → backend ships full
 * world data (byte-identical to pre-#288 behaviour). This keeps the cold
 * boot path (where no map is mounted yet) and the world-zoomed view
 * unchanged.
